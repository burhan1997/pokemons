Squirtle is a water-type Pokémon, and it's often described as a small, turtle-like creature. It's known for its blue shell and its ability to shoot powerful water attacks from its mouth. Squirtle is a popular choice for new Pokémon Trainers as a starter Pokémon, alongside Charmander and Bulbasaur. Trainers embark on journeys to catch, train, and battle with Squirtle and other Pokémon as they strive to become Pokémon Masters. Squirtle's evolutions include Wartortle and Blastoise, making it a strong and reliable companion in the world of Pokémon.
