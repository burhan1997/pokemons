Charmander is a Fire-type Pokémon. It's characterized by its bright orange skin and a tail that is constantly burning with a flame. This flame not only serves as a symbol of its health and vitality but also as a source of its fiery attacks. Charmander is a popular choice for aspiring Pokémon Trainers who appreciate the thrill of Fire-type battles.

As a first-stage Pokémon, Charmander evolves into Charmeleon and, later, into the powerful Fire/Flying-type Pokémon, Charizard. Charmander is known for its fierce determination, making it a loyal companion to Trainers who seek to conquer Pokémon Gyms and face tough challenges on their journey to become Pokémon Masters.
