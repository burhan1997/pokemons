Togepi is a small, Fairy-type Pokémon. It's recognized by its egg-shaped body with a cute, innocent face. Togepi is known for its signature move, "Metronome," which allows it to use a random move from any other Pokémon. This unpredictability adds an element of surprise to battles involving Togepi.

Togepi is also unique because it evolves based on friendship. When it forms a strong bond with its Trainer, it can evolve into Togetic, and later, when its friendship is strong enough, it can further evolve into Togekiss. Togekiss is known for its grace and beauty and is a powerful Flying/Fairy-type Pokémon.
